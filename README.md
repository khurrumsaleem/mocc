MOCC
===================

MOCC is a Method of Characteristics-based nuclear reactor neutronics analysis code. I wrote MOCC in support of my Ph.D. thesis while a student at the University of Michigan, and it's main feature is an implementation of the 2-D/3-D method that is described in depth in my [thesis](https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/handle/2027.42/135759).
The project draws inspiration from the [MPACT](https://www.ornl.gov/node/29646) code, but places a strong emphasis on sound software design, code re-usability and efficiency.

Documentation
-------
MOCC is thoroughly documented using Doxygen. Code documentation can be built by setting an appropriate output directory in `Doxyfile` and running Doxygen. Directions for configuring and building MOCC can be found in the resulting HTML.
